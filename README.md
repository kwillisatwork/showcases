## About Me
I specialize in identifying vulnerabilities in web applications, APIs, and enterprise systems. This repository contains proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits and payloads Iâ€™ve developed during my work as a penetration tester.

Feel free to explore the payloads and methodologies to see the depth of my work.
